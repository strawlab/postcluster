Analysis of kmeans-based cluster results.

This is a Python implementation of cluster quality metrics as
described in:

  Braun E, Geurten B, Egelhaaf M (2010) `Identifying Prototypical Components in
  Behaviour Using Clustering Algorithms
  <http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009361>`_.
  PLoS ONE 5(2): e9361. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009361

The original source code given by Braun et al is included, as is a
Python implementation of the same quality metrics. Included unit tests
ensure that the two implementations produce the same results.

The library is open sourced, and is licensed under the GPL v 2 or later.
